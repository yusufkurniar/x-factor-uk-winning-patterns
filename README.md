This project uses census-level data from the regular broadcast series of The X Factor UK (Series 1–15). Two datasets are used: Acts and Ratings. 

The Acts dataset contains contestant-level information, including the winning act, competition result, age, season, judge mentor, and category. The Ratings dataset provides season-level metrics, including episode counts, air dates, and average UK viewership. The combined use of these datasets enables analysis of the following business question: “which category had the highest success rate for winning across all seasons of The X Factor UK, and whether the age of the contestants or the specific judge significantly impacted the victories in that category?” and to address the sub-questions:

1. Which contestants won each season, including their age at the time of winning, competition category, and mentoring judge?
2. How frequently did each judge mentor a winning contestant within a specific category?
3. How often did each contestant category win across all seasons?
4. What is the age distribution of winners over time?
5. How did television ratings vary across seasons?

Data Limitation: This analysis relies exclusively on publicly available Wikipedia data. Episode-level rating information is not available for all seasons. Therefore, viewer analysis is limited to season-level average ratings.
