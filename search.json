The series overview page provides structured tabular information on season-level television ratings, while individual season pages contain detailed tables in the Acts section, including winning contestants, judges, contestant ages, and competition categories.\nThe data represents census-level information from the regular broadcast series of The X Factor UK (Series 1–15). All data is publicly available and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike 4.0 license.\nThe ratings table is primarily used to address sub-question 5 (viewer ratings over time), while the acts table supports the main business question and remaining sub-questions related to contestant characteristics and outcomes.\n\n\n\nData Dictionary and Variable Definitions\n\nData Dictionary\nHere is the detailed information about the variables used in each table:\n\nTable: Acts\n\nact: name of the contestant. (character)\nresult: contestant’s final placement in each season. (character)\nage: contestant’s age at the time of participation. (numeric)\nseries: season number in which the contestant appeared. (numeric)\njudges: judge mentoring the contestant. (character)\ncategories: competition category of the contestant. (character)\n\nTable: Ratings\n\nseries: season number. (numeric)\nepisodes: number of episodes in the season. (numeric)\nfirst_ep: first air date of the season. (date)\nlast_ep: final air date of the season.

(numeric)\n\n\n\n\nREADME\nAuthor: Yusuf Kurnia Romadhon\nRelease Date: 18 June 2025\nThis project uses census-level data from the regular broadcast series of The X Factor UK (Series 1–15). Two datasets are used: Acts and Ratings.\nThe Acts dataset contains contestant-level information, including the winning act, competition result, age, season, judge mentor, and category. The Ratings dataset provides season-level metrics, including episode counts, air dates, and average UK viewership. The combined use of these datasets enables analysis of the following business question: “which category had the highest success rate for winning across all seasons of The X Factor UK, and whether the age of the contestants or the specific judge significantly impacted the victories in that category?” and to address the sub-questions:\n\nWhich contestants won each season, including their age at the time of winning, competition category, and mentoring judge?\nHow frequently did each judge mentor a winning contestant within a specific category?\nHow often did each contestant category win across all seasons?\nWhat is the age distribution of winners over time?\nHow did television ratings vary across seasons?\n\nData Limitation: This analysis relies exclusively on publicly available Wikipedia data. Episode-level rating information is not available for all seasons. Therefore, viewer analysis is limited to season-level average ratings.\nLicenses: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 4.0\n\n\n\nData Collection Methodology\nThis section describes the methodology used to collect The X Factor UK data from Wikipedia.\n\nSource Review and Structure Validation. Each season page was reviewed to understand the structure and consistency of the available tables. During this review, a structural variation was identified in Series 12, where the table naming differed from other seasons. The data collection logic was designed to account for this inconsistency.\nLibrary Setup. Required R libraries were loaded to support web scraping, data manipulation, cleaning, and reproducible reporting.\n\n\n\nShow implementation details\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(rvest) # Web scraping\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Data manipulation, string manipulation, and reading and writing data\nlibrary(purrr) # Functional programming\nlibrary(janitor) # Cleaning data\nlibrary(polite) # Scraping websites responsibly\nlibrary(knitr) # Table design\n\n\n\nData Source Access. Wikipedia URLs containing the acts and ratings tables were accessed to retrieve season-level and contestant-level data for analysis.\n\n\n\nShow implementation details\n# Define season URL for The X Factor UK series overview (ratings)\nseason_url &lt;- read_html(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_TV_series)\")\n\n# Define season URLs for The X Factor UK series 1 to 15 (acts)\nseason_urls &lt;- paste0(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_TV_series)_series_\", 1:15)\n\n\n\nData Extraction. Data was scraped using responsible web-scraping practices, including the use of a polite session and custom user agent to minimise server impact and support ethical data access.\n\n\n\nShow implementation details\n# Define a polite session for ethical scraping\nsession &lt;- bow(\"https://en.wikipedia.org\", user_agent = \"Yusuf Kurnia Romadhon\")\n\n\n\nActs Table Definition and Cleaning. Contestant-level data (acts) was extracted from season-specific tables. Following extraction, data cleaning steps were applied to address inconsistencies, including: converting age values recorded as text into numeric format, standardising judge mentor names, and aligning column names across seasons. These steps ensured the dataset was suitable for comparative analysis.\n\n\n\nShow implementation details\n# Acts Table\n# Scrape acts table from acts section in each season\nscrape_acts_table &lt;- function(url) {\n  series_num &lt;- str_extract(url, \"series_\\\\d+\") |&gt; \n    str_remove(\"series_\") |&gt; as.integer()\n\n  page &lt;- tryCatch(read_html(url), error = function(e) return(NULL))\n  if (is.null(page)) return(tibble())\n\n  tables &lt;- page |&gt; html_elements(\"table.wikitable\")\n  candidate_tables &lt;- tables |&gt;\n    map(~ tryCatch(html_table(.x, fill = TRUE), error = function(e) NULL)) |&gt;\n    compact()\n\n  # Detect table with expected columns\n  acts_table &lt;- candidate_tables |&gt;\n    keep(~ all(c(\"Age(s)\", \"Hometown\", \"Category (mentor)\", \"Result\") %in% names(.x)) &&\n           any(c(\"Act\", \"Contestant\") %in% names(.x))) |&gt;\n    first()\n\n  if (is.null(acts_table)) return(tibble())\n\n  # Rename Contestant to Act if needed\n  if (\"Contestant\" %in% names(acts_table)) {\n    names(acts_table)[names(acts_table) == \"Contestant\"] &lt;- \"Act\"\n  }\n\n  # Clean column names first so we can use age_s\n  acts_table &lt;- acts_table |&gt; clean_names()\n\n  # Compute derived fields and normalisation\n  acts_table &lt;- acts_table |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      #redefine age\n      age = case_when(\n        str_detect(age_s, \"–|&|-\") ~ map_dbl(str_extract_all(age_s, \"\\\\d+\"), ~ mean(as.numeric(.x))),\n        str_detect(age_s, \"\\\\d+\") ~ as.numeric(str_extract(age_s, \"\\\\d+\")),\n        TRUE ~ NA_real_\n      ),\n      age = round(age),\n      #redefine series\n      series = series_num,\n      #redefine judges\n      judges = str_extract(category_mentor, \"(?&lt;=\\\\().+?(?=\\\\))\"),\n      categories = str_trim(str_remove(category_mentor, \"\\\\s*\\\\(.*\\\\)\")),\n      judges = case_when(\n        judges == \"Cowell\" ~ \"Simon Cowell\",\n        judges == \"Osbourne\" ~ \"Sharon Osbourne\",\n        judges == \"Walsh\" ~ \"Louis Walsh\",\n        judges == \"Minogue\" ~ \"Dannii Minogue\",\n        judges == \"Cole\" ~ \"Cheryl\",\n        judges == \"Gary Barlow\" ~ \"Gary Barlow\",\n        judges == \"Tulisa\" ~ \"Tulisa Young\",\n        judges == \"Kelly Rowland\" ~ \"Kelly Rowland\",\n        judges == \"Fernandez-Versini\" ~ \"Cheryl\",\n        judges == \"Mel B\" ~ \"Mel B\",\n        judges == \"Scherzinger\" ~ \"Nicole Scherzinger\",\n        judges == \"Field\" ~ \"Ayda Field\",\n        judges == \"Tomlinson\" ~ \"Louis Tomlinson\",\n        judges == \"Williams\" ~ \"Robbie Williams\",\n        judges == \"Barlow\" ~ \"Gary Barlow\",\n        judges == \"Ora\" ~ \"Rita Ora\",\n        TRUE ~ judges\n      ),\n      categories = case_when(\n        categories %in% c(\"Over 25s\", \"Over 26s\", \"Over 28s\", \"Over 29s\") ~ \"Overs\",\n        categories %in% c(\"16-24s\", \"16–24s\") ~ \"Young Adults\",\n        TRUE ~ categories\n      )\n    ) |&gt;\n    select(act, result, age, series, judges, categories)\n\n  return(acts_table)\n}\n\n# Apply scraping for Acts Table\nacts_all &lt;- map_df(season_urls, scrape_acts_table)\n\n# Write csv for checking\nwrite_csv(acts_all, \"data/xfactor_acts.csv\")\n\n\n\nRatings Table Definition and Cleaning.

As a long-running reality singing competition created by Simon Cowell, the show featured a structured format in which judges mentored specific contestant categories across each season.\nAlthough The X Factor UK was cancelled by ITV in 2021 (Wilson, 2021), public statements by Simon Cowell in 2024 indicated interest in reviving the franchise (Sweetnam, 2024). The programme originally aired for 15 seasons between 2004 and 2018, generating a substantial historical record of contestants, judges, categories, and audience ratings.\nThis project is motivated by an interest in examining these historical patterns through data. Using publicly available data from Wikipedia, the analysis explores factors associated with winning outcomes across all seasons, with particular focus on contestant categories, age groups, and judge mentorship. The goal is to move beyond anecdotal perceptions of success and provide a data-driven perspective on what has historically influenced winning outcomes in The X Factor UK.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nSub-question 1: Winners by Season, Age, Category, and Judge\nWhich contestants won each season, including their age at the time of winning, competition category, and mentoring judge?\nThis section examines the winning contestant from each season of The X Factor UK, including their age at the time of winning, competition category, and mentoring judge. The summary provides a complete season-by-season overview of winning outcomes across all 15 series.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Winner Acts by Series, Age, Judge, and Category\n\n\nseries\nact\nage\njudges\ncategories\n\n\n\n\n1\nSteve Brookstein\n35\nSimon Cowell\nOvers\n\n\n2\nShayne Ward\n21\nLouis Walsh\nYoung Adults\n\n\n3\nLeona Lewis\n21\nSimon Cowell\nYoung Adults\n\n\n4\nLeon Jackson\n18\nDannii Minogue\nBoys\n\n\n5\nAlexandra Burke\n20\nCheryl\nGirls\n\n\n6\nJoe McElderry\n18\nCheryl\nBoys\n\n\n7\nMatt Cardle\n27\nDannii Minogue\nBoys\n\n\n8\nLittle Mix\n19\nTulisa Young\nGroups\n\n\n9\nJames Arthur\n24\nNicole Scherzinger\nBoys\n\n\n10\nSam Bailey\n36\nSharon Osbourne\nOvers\n\n\n11\nBen Haenow\n29\nSimon Cowell\nOvers\n\n\n12\nLouisa Johnson\n17\nRita Ora\nGirls\n\n\n13\nMatt Terry\n23\nNicole Scherzinger\nBoys\n\n\n14\nRak-Su\n26\nSimon Cowell\nGroups\n\n\n15\nDalton Harris\n24\nLouis Tomlinson\nBoys\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 highlights a structural difference in category naming during the early seasons of the programme. In Series 2 and 3, the category labelled Young Adults was used instead of separate Boys and Girls categories. Further review of the programme format indicates that these early seasons featured only three judges, resulting in male and female contestants under the age of 24 being grouped into a single category. From later seasons onward, the category structure was standardised, allowing for clearer separation between age and gender-based categories.\n\n\nSub-question 2: Winning Outcomes by Judge and Category\nHow frequently did each judge mentor a winning contestant within a specific category?\nTo address this question, the acts_all dataset was filtered to include only winning contestants identified in Sub-question 1. A stacked bar chart was then constructed by grouping wins by mentoring judge and competition category. Judges were ordered from highest to lowest total number of wins to facilitate comparison across mentoring outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of Winners by Judge\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 indicates that Simon Cowell was the most successful judge in terms of total winning outcomes, with four winners across three categories: Overs, Young Adults, and Groups. Cheryl, Dannii Minogue, and Nicole Scherzinger each mentored two winning acts during their respective tenures. In contrast, Louis Tomlinson, Louis Walsh, Rita Ora, Sharon Osbourne, and Tulisa Young each mentored one winning act. These results suggest that sustained success across multiple categories was concentrated among a small number of judges, rather than being evenly distributed across the judging panel.\n\n\nSub-question 3: Winning Distribution by Category\nHow often did each contestant category win across all seasons?\nTo summarise the distribution of winning outcomes across categories, the relative proportion of total wins by category was calculated and visualised to highlight differences in overall success rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Winning Percentage by Category\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows that the Boys category recorded the highest proportion of wins, accounting for 40% of all series victories. The Overs category ranked second with 20% of total wins. In contrast, the Girls, Groups, and Young Adults categories each accounted for 13.3% of winning outcomes across all seasons. This concentration of wins suggests a structural advantage for male solo contestants within the competition format over time.\n\n\nSub-question 4: Age Profile of Winning Contestants\nWhat is the age distribution of winners over time?\nTo examine the age profile of winning contestants, winner ages were grouped into three bands: under 18, under 25, and 25 or older. Aggregate counts were then calculated and visualised using a stacked bar chart to highlight differences across age groups and categories.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Winner Count by Age Group\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 indicates that contestants under 25 accounted for the majority of winning outcomes, with nine wins across all seasons. This indicates that younger contestants, particularly those in their late teens to early 20s, were the most successful on The X Factor UK. In contrast, contestants under 18 achieved only a single win, indicating limited success for the youngest age group. Furthermore, the 25-and-over group produced five winners, demonstrating that older contestants remained competitive, albeit with lower overall success compared to the under-25 group. Overall, the results suggest a competitive advantage for contestants in the under-25 age range, aligning with the show’s historical emphasis on emerging young talent.\n\n\nSub-question 5: Viewership Trends Across Series\nHow did television ratings vary across seasons?\nThis sub-question is examined using the ratings_all dataset, which contains season-level average UK viewership figures. Figure 4 presents a line chart of average UK viewership across all 15 series.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Average UK Viewers per Series\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows that The X Factor UK reached its highest viewership during season 7, peaking at an average of 14.1 million viewers. This suggests that Series 7 represented the peak of the programme’s popularity during its broadcast run. Following this peak, average viewership declined steadily across subsequent seasons, reaching 5.8 million viewers by the final series. This sustained downward trend indicates a gradual loss of audience engagement in later years, despite continued format consistency.\n\n\nMain Insight: What Drives Winning Outcomes in The X Factor UK?\nAcross all 15 seasons of The X Factor UK, the Boys category recorded the highest success rate, accounting for 40% of all winning acts. As shown in Figure 2, this makes the Boys category the most consistently successful category in the show’s history.\nContestant age also played a significant role in winning outcomes. As illustrated in Figure 3, contestants aged under 25 accounted for 9 of the 15 total winners, indicating a strong preference or sustained trend toward younger talent across seasons.\nJudge mentorship further influenced success, though its impact varied by category. While Figure 1 shows that Simon Cowell mentored the highest number of winners overall (four wins), none of these victories came from the Boys category. Instead, judges such as Dannii Minogue and Nicole Scherzinger were instrumental in mentoring winners within the Boys category.\nOverall, these findings suggest that category and contestant age were the primary drivers of winning success, while judge influence was more category-specific rather than universally dominant.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nConsistent with the main insight, the Boys category emerged as the most successful group across all seasons of The X Factor UK, accounting for six wins out of fifteen seasons (40%).\nContestant age also played a decisive role in winning outcomes. Performers aged under 25 accounted for 60% of all winners (9 out of 15), indicating a clear and consistent preference for younger talent among audiences throughout the series.\nJudge influence further shaped winning patterns, though its impact varied by category. While Simon Cowell was the most successful judge overall, mentoring four winning acts, none of these victories came from the Boys category. Instead, judges such as Dannii Minogue and Nicole Scherzinger were particularly effective in mentoring winners within this category. This suggests that while some judges achieved broad success, others demonstrated strong category-specific specialisation.\nFinally, audience engagement followed a clear lifecycle trend. The X Factor UK reached its peak average viewership in Season 7, with 14.1 million viewers, before experiencing a steady decline in subsequent seasons, ending at 5.8 million viewers in the final season. This pattern highlights both the cultural peak of the program and the gradual erosion of audience interest over time.\nIn summary, winning outcomes on The X Factor UK were driven primarily by contestant category and age, with judge influence acting as a secondary, category-dependent factor amid declining audience engagement over time.\n\n\nReferences\nFirke, S.

All data collection, data cleaning, analysis, visualisation, and interpretation were independently designed, implemented, and validated by the author.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation and Technical Challenges\nThis project involved a substantial amount of data cleaning and standardisation that would not typically be visible in a public-facing blog post. The primary challenge stemmed from inconsistencies in the way data was presented across Wikipedia pages for different seasons of The X Factor UK.\nJudge and category names were not consistently recorded across seasons. For example, some judge names appeared in abbreviated or alternative forms (e.g., “Cowell”, “Cole”), requiring manual mapping to standardised full names (e.g., “Simon Cowell”, “Cheryl”) to ensure analytical consistency. Similarly, category labels varied between early and later seasons, necessitating additional harmonisation before aggregation.\nThe age variable also required careful handling. In several cases, ages were recorded as ranges (e.g., “17–24”) or as multiple values for group acts. These entries could not be directly analysed and required string parsing, conditional logic, and numeric conversion, including the use of averaging where appropriate, to produce a consistent numeric representation.\nWeb scraping itself was time-intensive due to structural inconsistencies in Wikipedia tables across seasons. Some tables contained missing columns, alternative header names, or differing layouts, which introduced errors during automated extraction. These issues were addressed through defensive programming techniques, including conditional checks and tryCatch() logic, to ensure the scraping process could adapt to structural variation without failing.\nOverall, the most time-consuming and least “visible” aspect of this project was the standardisation of inconsistent table formats and naming conventions. While these tasks were not analytically exciting, they were essential for ensuring data quality, comparability across seasons, and the validity of downstream analysis.\n\n\nTechnical Challenges and Problem Solving\nA key challenge in this analysis was the variation in table structures across Wikipedia pages for different seasons of The X Factor UK. While most seasons followed a broadly consistent format, some exceptions required additional handling. For example, Season 12 used a different column header (“Contestant” instead of “Act”), necessitating conditional renaming logic to ensure consistency across datasets.\nIn several cases, tables did not contain the expected columns, which caused errors during automated scraping and resulted in incomplete or incorrect outputs. To address this, defensive programming techniques were implemented, including validation checks and fallback logic to identify, skip, or adapt to malformed tables. This required careful code review and iterative testing to stabilise the scraping process.\nAs part of this project, I also strengthened my web scraping skills, particularly through the use of rvest and purrr to systematically collect data across multiple URLs. While web scraping was not a technique I had previously used extensively, this project required designing a robust workflow capable of automatically extracting, cleaning, and integrating data from heterogeneous web sources.\nDespite structural inconsistencies across pages, the original analytical scope was retained. The final outcome was a reliable and reproducible data pipeline that could consistently extract, standardise, and join data across all seasons.\n\n\nLimitations and Future Extensions\nOne limitation of this analysis is its exclusive focus on winning contestants. While winners provide a clear outcome measure, excluding runners-up and finalists may overlook additional performance patterns and competitive dynamics that influence success. Incorporating broader placement data could provide a more comprehensive view of category and judge effects.\nContestant age was grouped into three broad categories to support high-level comparison. While effective for identifying overall trends, future analysis could examine continuous age measures or median ages within categories to provide more granular insights.\nThe ratings analysis was constrained by data availability, as episode-level ratings were not consistently available across seasons. As a result, the analysis relies on season-level average viewership, which limits the ability to assess short-term audience responses to specific contestants, judges, or live-show events.\nThe analysis also implicitly assumes that judge–category combinations had comparable opportunities to produce winners across seasons. In practice, changes to the show’s format, judging panel composition, and voting mechanisms over time may have influenced competitive balance.\nFuture extensions could incorporate public engagement indicators such as social media activity, voting data, or contestant progression through live shows to better capture audience influence. From a technical perspective, the scraping workflow could be further improved by persisting cleaned datasets locally to reduce reliance on live website structures and improve long-term reproducibility.\nOverall, while these limitations constrain the scope of inference, the data and methods used are appropriate for the questions addressed in this project and provide a solid foundation for further analytical expansion."
